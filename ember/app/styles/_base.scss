 * Fonts, Colors, and Links:
 * We use Open Sans, and fall back to sans-serif if Google fonts don't load 
 * or the client chokes on the web font for some reason.
 *
 * The base font size is 1rem (or 16px), and the base line-height is 
 * 24px, for a ratio of 1.5. That ratio is used to set the vertical rhythm
 * for text and spacing around the site. See below for more on vertical rhythm.
 *
 * Base font-weight is 400 (or normal), the color is #333, and all text is
 * antialiased by default.
 *
 * Links are blue (#128cf4) without an underline. 
 * On hover a blue underline appears.
 *
 *      @example
 *      p
 *          |The <a href="http://fema.gov">Federal Emergency Management Agency</a>
 *          | says it is prepared to reopen all
 *          |144,000 insurance claims that resulted from Superstorm Sandy in 2012.
 *      p
 *          |The move comes after months of questions over whether insurance 
 *          |companies contracted by the National Flood Insurance Program 
 *          |fraudulently altered engineering reports.
 *      p
 *          |After thousands of homeowners said their insurance claims were 
 *          |systematically lowballed, FEMA began negotiations in an attempt 
 *          |to regain the trust of policy holders.
